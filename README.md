**DESCRIPTION:**


## ðŸ“Œ Task 4: SPEECH-RECOGNITION-SYSTEM


It is a **Speech Recognitionâ€“based Device Control System** using **Arduino UNO**.  
Since **Tinkercad** does not provide a Speech Recognition Module (like Elechouse Voice Recognition V3), I have simulated the speech input using the **Serial Monitor**.

In real hardware, the commands would be captured using a speech module and processed by Arduino to control devices such as lights or fans.  
In Tinkercad simulation, I type the commands into the Serial Monitor to mimic speech input.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Control multiple devices using voice commands *(simulated via Serial Monitor in Tinkercad)*.
- Supports commands:
  - `Light On`
  - `Light Off`
  - `Fan On`
  - `Fan Off`
- Can be adapted to work with real Voice Recognition hardware.

---

## ðŸ›  Components Used (Tinkercad Simulation)
- Arduino UNO  
- Breadboard  
- 2 Ã— LEDs (Light, Fan)  
- 2 Ã— 220Î© Resistors  
- Jumper Wires  

> **Note:** In a real setup, an **Elechouse Voice Recognition Module V3** or similar would replace the Serial Monitor input.
